## Vacation

I just returned from a vacation
which started Aug 2.
I didn't do much work while I was away.

## Interns

My interns are gone :(

I made a
[list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17vS60Y5hfRKI6l7dNHc66gSdrYZ6vyfsjbwqEGNAoNg/edit#heading=h.jq8jejc4d8ql)
of some of the things they did this summer.

## Book Production

Before vacation,
I reviewed and discussed
[the Refactor Archive document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YDVkJv9xXKk3NGAk_hOb1Q9nwIcu8Ml_xqQefwgbNrg/edit#heading=h.ezxqnb89oz9v)
by PhilS and Mulich.
I think 
[my understanding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YDVkJv9xXKk3NGAk_hOb1Q9nwIcu8Ml_xqQefwgbNrg/edit#heading=h.aexq816r0rxc)
of what is being done matches theirs,
and agree that it's an improvement over the current situation.
And I think we all agree that it's only one step
toward a more permanent solution,
and not the end goal.

## Improving PDF Distribution

I've been reviewing
[this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mjsClBdkrctdA7KErWtxQEDMoRiQ7v4kQMdqj-4VdYQ/edit?ts=5d547d8a),
trying to get a handle on what is wanted.

I've started learning the details of AWS CloudFront,
and was able to get it to serve an image from an S3 bucket.
I was also able to assign my own domain name
to my CloudFront distribution,
which should eliminate the ugly URLs
that we currently end up using.
