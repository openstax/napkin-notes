## Cleanup of Loose Ends

I am very close
to being able to build
all Biglearn-related AWS infrastructure
from scatch via CloudFormation templates.

Two pieces remain:
* automatic storage of secrets
* automatic creation of IAM roles and policies

AWS recently rolled out a SecretsManager service.
It looks really good, and is easy to use.
The ruby `aws-sdk` gem supports it,
so I might try to use it
in lieu of S3 buckets.

## BL API Endpoints

My plan is to just work from home next week
so I can focus on just busting out
the BL-API endpoints
and doing some at-scale performance testing.
