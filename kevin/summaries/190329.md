## Dante

Dante is back home, and looking *much* better.
He's thinking about working remotely from home.

## Biglearn Intern Interviews

I have my three summer interns,
and the remainder of the BL applicants
have become fodder for some other positions
that didn't have as many applicants.

## AWS Organization/Account Setup

I was able to create a CloudFormation template
to setup an empty AWS account with:
* `admin` and `dev` groups
* `admin` and `dev` roles (with an initial set of associated policies)
* an initial S3 bucket for templates needed by deploy scripts

This is useful because:
* the setup can be under version control, which makes it reviewable
* DevOps won't need to setup groups/roles/policies by hand
* DevOps can copy the setup across accounts
* folks with admin abilities can still act as though they were normal devs,
  making it possible to repeat dev-specific issues
* adding/removing folks from a project, or adjusting their roles, is super easy

## CNX CLI Pipeline

It seems like this has been moving along nicely,
though I haven't been keeping a close eye on it lately.

## CNX Server Pipeline Tech Brief

I reviewed this in detail,
and we had a meeting about it on Monday.
The short version
is that all the questions I had
about how the pipeline would be used,
and by whom, and with what APIs, etc.,
turned out to be pretty ubiquitous
across all devs.

It seems that the bottom line
was that the user stories
aren't well understood,
at least in terms devs can understand and implement.
So Ed is working on that.
I don't envy him.
