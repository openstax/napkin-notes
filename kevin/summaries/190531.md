## Interns

The interns have been plugging away
on the following three tasks:
* create CloudFormation templates for Aurora db clusters
* figure out whether or not SecretsManager offers us anything over ParameterStore in terms of secret rotation
* figure out why our JSON schema/data validator is so freaking slow

It looks like they will be mostly done with these tasks
by the end of this week.

I think the next steps
will be to start iterating
on an always-up API server.
This will help us figure out
what we need
in terms of toolings, tests, designs, etc.

I looked at our `aws-ruby` gem.
It seems promising,
but I don't think we'll be using it initially.
But as we learn 
exactly how certain features should work,
we can think about folding them into the gem.

## Research Requirements for Tutor/Biglearn

I compiled some notes
from talks with Grimaldi and Drew
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krk4l9AXse-9RkRWW0Jn9mdLMO4VZH4GWeSt3DYRn9Q/edit#heading=h.nk185znd2on).
The plan is to clean them up
and discuss next steps
with Carly and Dante on Monday.
