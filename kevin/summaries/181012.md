## Recipe-Based Pipelines

We met on Mon to discuss
[Round 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OS09KhgjmVJOkI6O5Rvb1w7xSRFOfWuWSuIPlpG6Cnk/edit#)
of my Thoughts on CNX writeup.
It seemed to go pretty well,
so now I've been tasked by Ed
to create a list of pieces
that we need to build
for dicussion this coming Mon.

Currently, I'm mainly focusing
on the transformations we apply to the CNXML/XHTML
so that I can clearly determine
whether or not they are common of specific.
This is also helping me 
to figure out which transformations
(a) should be libraries vs services, and
(b) might be serious bottlenecks.

## Review of Unicorn/a15k-related Designs and Docs

I looked over JP's writeup 
on the Unicorn architecture
as well as his pro/con writeup 
comparing AWS to the Rice Data Center,
and gave feedback as I saw fit.
I also went to his Unicorn discussion
with Ed and Michael H.

## OOD Talk on Monday

Since it came up in the all-devs meeting
and in the #pewpew channel,
I offered to give a talk
from a few years ago
that covers the key concepts
of object-oriented design.
People seem interested,
so hopefully it aligns
with what they are looking to learn.
