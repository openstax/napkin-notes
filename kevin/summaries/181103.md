## Reading List Update

I added a classic paper by Pat Helland to my
[reading list](https://github.com/openstax/napkin-notes/blob/master/kevin/summaries/reading_list.md)
because it describes data properties 
that came up while I was reviewing
[JP's Kafka executive summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BXli93VH_jRAPw3hs67UcQpkeQW0bsFZOcLkR3zeSpU/edit?pli=1#heading=h.grhpyemwjust),

## Recipe-Based Pipelines

PhilS and I
walked through the process
of converting CNXML
to a PDF -
he was super helpful.
I was able to execute
most of the steps
locally in the Docker containers
I'd been building
over the last two weeks.

We ran into a few snags along the way.
First, I needed (and, apparently, still need)
access to `devb`
in order to convert CNXML to XHTML
(the first stage of the pipeline).
The baking process failed
for my chosen test book (Physics).
We still don't know
exactly what happened.
I was later able
to bake a Biology book, though.
I was able to convert
the baked books to PDF,
but the styling
doesn't look anything
like a real OpenStax book,
so I need to figure out why.
