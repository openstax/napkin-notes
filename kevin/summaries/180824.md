## CNX Guide

Most of my time lately has been spent on trying to understand CNX.

I created 
[this diagram](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rIW041EHBmQXVR1nvvlO7YNp2SWMN-8SOFzjVnsV0V0/edit#heading=h.gvuy5upcdzqh)
after a talk with Helene
(she shed a LOT of light on the editing and publishing processes!).

However, it's not quite accurate in places
and doesn't map very well to the CNX codebases.
I'm in the process of creating a
[developer-centric guide to the CNX code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJCae0LXebQ6AVnjvNN_gzmmFRFK1a2L10uDO1eiuH0/edit#heading=h.jm1bty5a6ywr).

My goals are:
* be able to clearly and accurately describe 
the workflows, data formats, deployment environments, etc.,
* be able to direct folks to the code responsible for specific functionality
* be able to compare/contrast the legacy and rewrite workflows and codebases
* resolve discrepancies between different folks' views of CNX

Once the guide is reasonably complete,
I think we can better assess CNX as a whole
and then decide what steps to take in the future.
