## CNX Guide

Once again, most of my time lately has been spent on trying to understand CNX.

I've added a lot of notes to my
[CNX Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJCae0LXebQ6AVnjvNN_gzmmFRFK1a2L10uDO1eiuH0/edit#heading=h.jm1bty5a6ywr),
as well as sequence diagrams
showing how the different pieces of code
interact with each other.
I've been updating Bryan on these,
and he's been reading them
and providing feedback.
They're still a work in progress,
but they're coming along
and will probably form
the core of guide.

I finally got to the bottom
of what happens when someone "publishes"
in legacy CNX.
I'm now in the process of doing the same
for the rewrite codebase,
and hopefully I'll have my comparison done soon.

Ed, Ross, JP and I
met last week
to discuss where I'm at,
my current thinking, 
what we want to get out of this adventure,
and all that stuff.
I'm tweaking my approach slightly
to focus a bit sooner
on slightly different questions.
E.g., a but less "What does it do?" and a bit more "Why is it hard to figure out what it does?".
Hopefully the latter
will help guide decision making
for future CNX work
(as well as other projects, as appropriate).

Here's how my goals are progressing:
* be able to clearly and accurately describe 
the workflows, data formats, deployment environments, etc.,
  * done with what is likely the hardest part; hopefully progress on the rest will be speedier
* be able to direct folks to the code responsible for specific functionality
  * I'm feeling more and more comfortable with this as I wrap my head around the codebases
* be able to compare/contrast the legacy and rewrite workflows and codebases
  * at least half done, probably more
* resolve discrepancies between different folks' views of CNX
  * this will happen as people start to review my docs/diagrams/etc.

## Types in Programming Languages

PhilS suggested a future discussion about this.
I have many thoughts on this,
so I wrote them down
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19uAwUUeWcUhwJ2g7iSe4cAUtBJMRP774b6RaSS5jQek/edit#heading=h.dbmxgio57kxr).
It's not quite done,
but I think it provides
a good starting point
and clarifies some definitions
and common misunderstandings.
