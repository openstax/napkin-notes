## Event Fetch Code for Internal APIs

I extracted this code
into some high-level functions
that JP can transfer
into a gem.

I also reviewed
JP's `WorkCrew` gem
(which encapsulates my `Protocol` code),
and took a quick look at some specs
that I had left in a failing state.
It's not really a big deal,
but this code poses
some interesting challenges
for writing clean specs.

## Mike A.'s Investigation of Self-Organizing Systems

I looked over 
[a paper](http://www.complexityforum.com/members/Eoyang%202004%20Conditions%20for%20self-org.pdf)
that Mike A. has been reading
related to self-organizing human systems.
The ideas are interesting, but non-quantitative
(at least as far as I've gotten).
I think they are related
to some thoughts I've had
on designs and testing,
so I'm working on short paper on the topic
(hopefully like the one I wrote on meetings).

## Probably Taking a Long Fourth

The last few weeks
have been very slow for me
when it comes to coding.
I'll probably take some extra days off
on either side of the 4th
to try to reset.

Sorry.
