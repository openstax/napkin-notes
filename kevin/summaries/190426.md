## Dante

It looks like Dante is back!
At least mostly kinda.

## Planning for Interns

I've spent a bunch of time this week
planning for my interns.
I'll be ramping up a LOT
in the next two weeks.

## CNX

It seems like we're opening up user stories again,
I'm not sure why.
Are we building a different CLI tool?
Did business needs change?
Did we NOT reach consensus?
Were we missing stakeholders?
Because people really like meetings?

I'm trying to write up my thoughts on this
(and I *do* have thoughts on this)
but it's taking me a while
because I'm trying to package them
in a quasi-neutral tone
in the hope that folks will not 
take them too personally
or worry about my sanity.
