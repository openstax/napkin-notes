## Intern Planning

I've been ramping up
my planning for this summer.

I've pretty much laid out
how to get my interns up to speed
on Rails-related topics.

Next, I turn my attention
to AWS services, etc.,
and deployments.

This is going to be my focus
during dig-out week.

## CNX

CNX took up a LOT more time this week
than I would've hoped.

I don't think it's doing anything for anyone
by having me half-involved
(e.g., not being at seemingly important meetings,
but still reviewing stuff and offering inputs).
Either I should be involved in the process, or not.
And I'll have plenty of other stuff
to keep me busy this summer...
