## CreatorFest

So that happened.
Seemed like quite the success!
Go us!

## Thoughts on Meetings

I wrote up some
[thoughts on meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gbkZDNpxLc7kq_KMSfdGQo76Z-VRC1hBl7-jHbcwi0I/edit?usp=sharing).
People seemed to find it interesting.
Kathi posted some 
[nice Spotify videos](https://medium.com/project-management-learnings/spotify-squad-framework-part-i-8f74bcfcd761)
which had a similar vibe.
I think it is worth noting
that ZDT deployments
enable much of what they have achieved.

## ZDT Migrations

I've been doing more and more ZDT migrations
(even though I really don't need to...yet)
and they have been going well so far.
I've added new columns with not-null constraints,
concurrently added indexes without locking tables, etc.

I also like how I know something works
when I have been able to push it into a running environment.
It makes "done means done" make much more sense.

## Cleanup of Loose Ends

I've converted my infrastructure code
to use the `aws-sdk` gem to modify infrastructure
(issue autoscaling requests, monitor health, do deployments, etc.),
replacing somewhat clumsy calls to shell scripts.

I've started recording
various healthcheck events
in the database, which 
(a) makes it much easier to follow what is happening, and
(b) allows that data to be used for autoscaling, etc.

## Assorted a15k Discussions

JP and I have had a few discussions
about a15k deployment strategies.

## Back to BL API Endpoints?

I didn't quite get here
due to CreatorFest and the All-Hands,
but I should be back on it
starting next week.
