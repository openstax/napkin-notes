## Folding In Event Bundling Code

I did this.

## Full-scale Performance Testing

I've started full-scale performance tests in AWS.
By "full-scale" I mean:
* 1M students spread across thousands of smaal- to mid-sized courses
* 3000 responses/second peak sustained load

It seems that IOPS,
and not CPU usage,
is often the limiting factor
in these full-scale tests.
`ActiveRecord` isn't exactly super efficient
when it comes to minimizing IO usage,
since it sends whole records
even when only one or two fields are being updated.
I'll need to check into that.

I'm also seeing occasional spikes in CPU and IO usage,
possibly related to bumping up against the IOPS limit
(which is currently based on the number of GB of storage).

For large MOOC-like classes,
I am going to create a separate ASG
which uses a different bundling algorithm.
The demands placed on the db
by many small classes
are at odds with those
due to fewer larger classes.
Using separate ASGs with separate bundling algorithms
should alleviate this.

For the full-scale tests
I'm currently using an `m4.2xlarge`
(which has 8 vCPUs)
and 700 GB of storage
(giving 2100 IOPS).
This setup would cost roughly $650/month and,
aside from the details mentioned above,
seems to handle the 1M student workload reasonably well.
This means that `Biglearn`
would cost roughly 2 cents/student.

Some plots for fun:
