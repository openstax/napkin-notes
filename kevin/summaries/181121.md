## Recipe-Based Pipelines

I'm trying to fold in all the new things
that I learned from Helene and Ryan
over the last two-or-so weeks.
My initial attempt is
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aN431M6c7O-8EI8t9h1GLL68ZsHhoKg_d-rOtt4H2SE/edit#heading=h.b2khqsm2ozg8),
but it's still very rough.

The takeaway from this
is that the use cases for the PDF pipeline
have a significant impact on its design
(which really isn't too surprising).
In concrete terms,
the pieces of the pipeline
that I've outlined
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BnS8Nq0VMpINlOaCZSswGHPt6Mti0vMnVyjhd1W8vA0/edit#heading=h.dapdzt39oa6n)
are still basically intact,
but we will probably want
to split them into three separate chunks,
each targeting specific use cases.

I cannot help but think
that we are recreating GitHub,
but for content development.

Dennis fixed my account on `devb`,
but I haven't tried to do anything with it yet.

## Editing-Related Stuff

I've been reviewing Michael Mulich's 
neb/press/batch writeups
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6I9LpLpLOKS7Uxe-HAF0q8f2oHd_VEknhLsfW8DFnY/edit#heading=h.6koay5toprkr),
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q3MlCleDFugFvIiqRg1vqSdR7ROPRgiBKtlOBadZav8/edit#heading=h.dzv01fznpee),
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nhw6RPqDb0ncYa_kMsO6oHmYfXICF24gKNPnyTHB5u8/edit),
and
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RPGgDSOxel7ZH76glbTgbU6PqSpcUgyUPzbDfS1vZi4/edit#heading=h.hek2h91h63l).

I taked with Michael
about his vision of how
all these things should work.
It was very useful,
and I'll be folding his inputs
into my writeups
as soon as possible.
