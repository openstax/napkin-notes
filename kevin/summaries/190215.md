## Dante

So that's still happening.

## Recipe-Based Pipelines

I spend a bunch of time this week
trying to figure out what to write
for the server-based CNX Baked-PDF Pipeline,
but didn't get very far.
Beyond what I wrote in the
[CNX Pipeline Conop and API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q4vCuz1KO3kpexw62070xYlejkQwesq_Bo-IwBl5tyk/edit#heading=h.972l33lqr541)
document,
I just don't have enough concrete details
to write down anything
that I think will be meaningful.

I did make a rough cut at the
["timeline" document"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q9W1rOqL4ZShQ-rEl_9foP9UtFMI3hjy8zRAqAqkFZQ/edit#heading=h.opb7lxe8vk5h)
that Kathi is interested in.
Maybe the most interesting things to come out of that
was just how much depends (directly or indirectly) on:
* whether or not we intend to treat content as code
* whether or not we get the tagging legend under version control

## Tutor/Biglearn Critsit(s)

We had a 
[post-mortem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q7Mzs5wuy_z3R4uvNHPXor-OPrNsFmdkEFMxUs4JIwU/edit)
for these on Monday.

## Unexpected Help on Biglearn?

I got messages from Meera and Ross
asking to learn more about Biglearn.
It seems like this must've been a result
of the planning meetings that happened last week,
but maybe that's just a coincidence.

It turns out that Carly is also looking
at some of the same Tutor features
that I am trying to sort out
(and write down) related to 
assignments, ecosystem updates, blacklisted exercises, etc.
We need to have a 100% solid understanding
of how these actually work
to make sure the Biglearn API tests
are correct going forward.
So I will probably get together with her
(and Nathan as well)
to make sure we're all in agreement
with each other and with the Tutor/Biglearn code.
