## Zero-Downtime Deployments and Migrations

I demoed this
to devops (and JP)
on Wednesday.
We had a good discussion
about various aspects of the design
and how it relates
to some specific devops concerns.
To me, most of the issues came down to:
* clarifications on how the current design works, and why
* the need to package this up into "canned architecture"

But I'm feeling pretty optimistic
that these can be addressed.

I also want
one million points
for not having a deployment failure
during the demo!
(Though, if I did,
it would've been automatically noticed
and rolled back -
that would've been worth ten million points!)

I have also been working
on deployment scripts 
to make the processes
simpler and more concrete.
It's going slower than I'd hoped
(mainly because it's a bunch of tool output processing),
but really it's just a matter 
of bringing all the pieces together.

## Kafka

I set up a Kafka cluster for JP.

In the process,
I was able to determine
how to fix the client failover problem
that I noticed last time I played with it.

Also, Kafka has moved to release 1.+,
which basically says that 
they think they're ready for general production use.
