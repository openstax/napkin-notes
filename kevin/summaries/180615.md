## Event Fetch Code for Internal APIs

I'm working on the code
that finds and returns new events
to users of the BL API's internal enpoints
(e.g., BL Scheduler).
The main reason for the adjustments
has been to try to limit the number of IOPS
as best as possible, since they're somewhat expensive,
but it might not be possible to do any better
than the current implementation.
So I'm trying to have this
wrapped up by Mon
so JP can start helping me
with creating some gems
and the endpoint code.

The last two weeks have been very slow going...
