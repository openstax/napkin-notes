## Recipe-Based Pipelines

We met on Mon/Thu to discuss
[Round 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OS09KhgjmVJOkI6O5Rvb1w7xSRFOfWuWSuIPlpG6Cnk/edit#)
of my Thoughts on CNX writeup.

From those meetings,
it seems to be clear
that we need a breakout
of the different change "axes":
* book-agnostic
* book-specific
* platform-agnostic
* platform-specific

I've started updating a
[Round 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WPilKjcP53yc4QKPyGljDA5pu4oGxpPAN_eB9aiTVTQ/edit#heading=h.dapdzt39oa6n)
of my document accordingly.

I still need to get a firm handle
on the transformations we apply to the CNXML/XHTML
so that I can clearly determine
whether or not they are common or specific.
This would also help me 
to figure out which transformations
(a) should be libraries vs services, and
(b) might be serious bottlenecks.

## OOD Talk

People seemed interested in the material,
but I think that folks would be more interested
in a TDD coding workshop.
That would give them some basics
that they could more easily focus on their specific needs.
