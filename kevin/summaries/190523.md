## Dig-Out Week

Dig-out week was glorious,
and I got a LOT of stuff done.

I was able to construct
a series of tutorials
to help them get their heads wrapped around
a whole bunch of interconncted topics:

Working with Dante,
I was also able to write down
the rules by which
personalized and spaced-practice exercises
are populated in different assignment types.
It turns out that there is a 
[relatively simple model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fsMDpLEsjNuJKc7ZUeyXai5j_I41HWX-kTgB8KtR4ZY/edit#heading=h.l2a7c9f6aybw)
that explains all the behaviors,
as long as we recognize
that there are actually three types of PEs.

## Interns

I've been bringing my interns
up to speed on the topics shown above.
They now have some stand-alone tasks
to tackle on their own
over the next few days.
