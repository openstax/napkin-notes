## Interns

The interns have been plugging away
building a Round 1 application
that we can put under load testing.

I plan to use next week
as a mini dig-out week
to assemble the bits and pieces of work
the interns have completed so far
into a coherent application.

## Thoughts on Complexity

I've started distilling
my 30+ pages of notes
into a (hopefully) coherent document
that will describe 
a few techniques we can use
to potentially keep a handle
on weird emergent behaviors
in our systems.

## Book Production

I reviewed some documents
from PhilS and Mulich.
Most of my feedback so far
related to clarifications
and deployment/testing.
