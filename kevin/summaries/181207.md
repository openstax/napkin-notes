So that happened.

## Problem with Biglearn Deployment

Thu night / Fri morning
I helped Carly and Nathan
try to figure out what happened
during the deployment.
It turned out that
there were some issues
with a slow migration.
The big questions on my mind
is why this was not caught
at QA/staging.

## Recipe-Based Pipelines

Karen seems pretty close
to having the pieces
of the PDF pipeline running.

## Writeups

I create a short description of
[CNX Environments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rz8wSqlf31zcxkqE-z9b-TQKRKZUpNNGwwTKWndvtoQ/edit#heading=h.moi11qb96kq5)
and related stuff.

I'm adding a section to my
[Reading List](https://github.com/openstax/napkin-notes/blob/master/kevin/summaries/reading_list.md)
to put keep all of these writeups in one place.
