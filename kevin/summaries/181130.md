## Recipe-Based Pipelines

It looks like we're re-focusing
on a simple command-line tool
to create PDFs.

This tool will likely be throw-away
at the high-level,
but we should be able to build
some long-term reusable building blocks
along the way.

Karen and I are working out the kinks
in the recipe-based pipeline steps.
I gave her my dockerfiles,
and she's been using them
in combination with some VMs.
We found a nasty bug
in one of the scripts,
but we know how to work around it now.

## Writeups

Larissa and Alina
(and others?)
have been reviewing my
[How We Build Books](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11RVX535Gv1j09u0baT3yTUgHtTnBkssvEWCFsw8rPp4/edit?ts=5c001598#heading=h.vq6f0s8tqd8a)
writeup.
They've brought up some good points and corrections,
and I folded them in
throughout the week.
