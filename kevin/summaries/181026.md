This week has been pretty mediocre.

## Recipe-Based Pipelines

We met on Mon/Tue to discuss
[Round 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WPilKjcP53yc4QKPyGljDA5pu4oGxpPAN_eB9aiTVTQ/edit#heading=h.dapdzt39oa6n)
of my Thoughts on CNX writeup.

I've been trying
to download the different repos
and run their code
against actual book content.
It's pretty slow going,
but I've managed to get
some docker containers
up and running.
Hopefully I'll be able
to manually walk through the processing stages
from CNXML all the way
to a styled book.

Short of having the vast majority
of those runs done
and a clear understanding of the code,
it's not obvious to me
what more I can do
to help advance the project
aside from writing things down.

## Autoscaling, Zero-Downtime Deployments, AuroraDb, and All That

I gave Carly a rundown
of the interplay
between AWS Aurora,
ASGs, ELBs, etc.,
and staging tests,
zero-downtime deployments,
migrations, feature flags,
and the like.
