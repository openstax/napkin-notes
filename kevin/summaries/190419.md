## Dante

Is he back yet?  Maybe.

## AWS IAM and VPCs

I've been working
on filling in some gaps
in my AWS knowledge.
It's going pretty well so far.
I think I've got a handle
on Identity and Access Management (IAM)
and Virtual Private Clouds (VPC).
These two areas
are of particular interest to DevOps,
and I want to make sure
we can keep them happy.

## AWS Aurora Postgres Serverless

It turns out that serverless
is currently only available
for a specific version of MySQL.
I did some basic testing
and it seemed to live up to my expectations.
It's not clear whether or not
the Postgres version
will be available by the end of the summer.
That doesn't really throw off any of my plans,
but it would be nice to know
exactly what the potential cost savings would be.

## Biglearn Feature Gathering

This is still happening.
It's slow going,
but it's coming along.
