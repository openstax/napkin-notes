## Vacation

My roadtrip was super fun and super relaxing.

## Unicorn Event Trade Study

I'm in the process
if creating a
[new iteration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rIW041EHBmQXVR1nvvlO7YNp2SWMN-8SOFzjVnsV0V0/edit#heading=h.d39jccd0dszr)
of my original
[Thoughts on CNX](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13oeC_Ytq2cD8j52ztttpG3sMXsliUM9rp_rPTmUDvNM/edit#heading=h.kh3o9xhcgamc)
document.

I recently created a diagram
based on a massive data dump from Helene.
She showed it to Alina and Alana,
and I'm waiting to incorporate their feedback.

Once I have a consensus from Content,
I will (hopefully) reconcile any discrepencies with Dev
(Ross, Mullich, PhilS, etc.)
and make sure the linkages between Epics, PRs, design docs, etc.,
all make sense.

On another front,
I've been digging into the details
of Kafka transactions
and database connectors.
These are relatively new,
and solve two HUGE problems:
* writing atomically to multiple streams
* converting back-and-forth between data streams and databases

## Kevin's Reading List

* [Exactly-once Semantics are Possible: Hereâ€™s How Kafka Does it](https://www.confluent.io/blog/exactly-once-semantics-are-possible-heres-how-apache-kafka-does-it/):
  This covers the core concepts and failure modes that need to be addressed.

* [Exactly-once Support in Apache Kafka](https://medium.com/@jaykreps/exactly-once-support-in-apache-kafka-55e1fdd0a35f):
  This is Jay Kreps' response to those who didn't think the above article was possible.
  (It also made me aware of
  [Kleppmann's book](https://dataintensive.net/)
  which I mentioned in my last update.)

* [Transactions in Apache Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/blog/transactions-apache-kafka/):
  This article is a follow-up to the first article,
  and explains more of the inner workings of the Kafka brokers and clients.
