## Dante

So that's still happening...but at least the beginning of the end might be in sight!

## Biglearn Intern Interviews

The vast majority of my week
went to interviewing interns for the summer.
The applicants were stronger than I expected,
which is really promising.
I'll be sending out offers
over the weekend (probably).

## 1-on-1 with Alana

I have a very interesting chat with Alana
as part of her engineering 1-on-1s.
It seems like there is some momentum
outside of Tutor/Biglearn/Devops
to try to get ZDT deployments working.
I think it'd be A Good Things
for me to discuss the work I've been doing
with them to make sure everyone is on the same page
in terms of potential approaches, drawbacks, etc.

I also plan to fold the improvements
that JP and Scotts have recently made
into my plans for Biglearn.
This should probably happen
before I talk to Alana's crowd.

## CNX CLI Pipeline

Apparently Karen and Helene 
went through a demo of the code
at some point this week.
I had hoped to attend
(just to listen in)
but unfortunately it was rescheduled
and I couldn't make it.
I'll try to get the rundown from Helene
to make sure that the move to neb
didn't negatively impact
any of the end users' needs.
