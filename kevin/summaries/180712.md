## Unicorn Event Trade Study

I've been focusing pretty heavily on this since roughly the start of July.

I've talked to pretty much everyone I can think of 
about how their systems / business processes
interact with other pieces of OpenStax.
The records of those conversations can be found
[in Gorilla.](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1dbzBkGC7uTk8p-WrKPArkTXJlj15ZUeL)

The next step is to start the writeup,
which I'm sure will involve asking a bunch of follow-up questions,
and also probably doing some quick-checks on specific technologies
to make sure their claims are reasonably accurate.

## Kevin's Reading List

I'm starting a list 
of books, papers, and webpages
that I've found especially interesting or useful for this project
and/or Biglearn.

* [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/):
  This book is an up-to-date encyclopedia 
  of distributed systems concepts and technologies
  and I cannot recommend it enough.
  It covers replication, partitioning, transactions, consensus, availability, consistency, etc.,
  and the connections between them.
  The end-of-chapter references
  point to many of the individual papers I've been reading
  (including recent work by my main man Peter Bailis!)
  but the book provides a supremely useful cross-cutting perspective on them.
  Worth its weight in gold.
* [Designing Event-Driven Systems](https://www.confluent.io/designing-event-driven-systems):
  By the makers of Kafka, 
  this book clearly explains
  the case for event streams.
  It also shows how to use new Kafka features
  (e.g., transactions, CDC, and KSQL)
  to build scalable, extensible streaming systems.
  It does a reasonable job
  at pointing out limitation and sticking points, too.
  
## Upcoming Vacation

I'm planning on a roadtrip
from here to Bend, OR
(with detours to Portland and Seattle)
between July 23 and Aug 10 (ish).
Kathi has mentioned 
I might need to attend some meetings
somtime in that first week,
so I'll budget some work time.
I should have internet access while not driving,
and will be checking email/slack daily.

## Random

I've felt really, really good the last few weeks.
Not really sure why.
