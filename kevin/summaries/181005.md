## Recipe-Based Pipelines

I updated
[Round 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OS09KhgjmVJOkI6O5Rvb1w7xSRFOfWuWSuIPlpG6Cnk/edit#)
of my Thoughts on CNX writeup to include:
* clarifications on common processing that we intend to share across all pipelines
* terminology updates
* possible logical pipeline specification format
* handling of non-Openstax content developers

I still need to add one for figure
showing how the logical breakdown
could be mapped to reusable physical components.
This will be more conceptual,
since my note is not meant to be an architecture document.

## Another Brain Dump From Helene

Helene and I met and discussed
the design of the styling framework
she and Thomas have developed
as well as various clarifications
on her model of how things should work
and what was written in my
[Round 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OS09KhgjmVJOkI6O5Rvb1w7xSRFOfWuWSuIPlpG6Cnk/edit#)
writeup.

## Next Steps

* hopefully finalize my Round 3 writeup and get it reviewed
* start looking at higher-level CNX design issues 
  (like the management of partner data, envionments, preview/publishing, etc.)
