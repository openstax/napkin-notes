## Stack Creation

I started down the path
of automating stack creation.
It's doable,
but it's going to take more than a few days,

## Folding In Event Bundling Code

I dusted off my event bundling code

into my autoscaling branch.

This will essentially complete the skeleton
of the BL API component
and allow in-cloud performance testing.
