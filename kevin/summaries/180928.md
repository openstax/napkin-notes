## Recipe-Based Pipelines

Essentially all of my time this week
has been spent studying
the new CNX recipe-based pipeline:
* [epic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pm9X6zGH2KoZFtuZ7-fW04-MVGdzcwmFQ_a1Fs5GxQM/edit#heading=h.wuc3pn1ckk21)
* [Trello](https://trello.com/c/bnr267Jb/134-generate-pdf-from-baked-html-so-we-have-one-book-compiling-system-and-are-set-up-for-unicorn-p14)
* [cnx-easybake](https://github.com/Connexions/cnx-easybake) repo
* [cnx-recipes](https://github.com/Connexions/cnx-recipes) repo
I also talked at length with PhilS and Helene.

This resulted in
[Round 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OS09KhgjmVJOkI6O5Rvb1w7xSRFOfWuWSuIPlpG6Cnk/edit#)
of my Thoughts on CNX writeups,
which is still in progress
but was essentially reviewed (at least at a high-level)
in a meeting with me, JP, PhilS, Ross, Helene, and Ed.

As an aside,
it was decided
during Q4 planning
that what I am writing
is effectively a "technical pre-brief"
since it doesn't actually define an architecture per-se.
But once everyone on CNX can agree on its contents,
we can derive a more formal technical brief
and architecture from it.

My next steps are:
* to update my Round 3 writeup to show how the many logical pipelines can be mapped to relatively few physical pipelines
  consisting of shared widgets (libraries, services, etc.) that
  (a) help devs maintain the system and 
  (b) allow Content to manage styling
* start looking at the higher-level design of CNX,
  including how content is developed by our partners,
  reviewed by OpenStax, and eventually released
  to the outside world

Helene and I
will be meeting on Wed so that: 
* she can bounce some more of her designs/visions off me and
* she can detail the interactions I need to understand for my higher-level CNX writeup
