## Recipe-Based Pipelines

Helene and I
were able to track down the cause 
of my PDF pipeline styling woes.
So now I can build
a Biology book
with Intro to Business styling
(but no images).

I'm still not able
to log into the `devb` server
to perform the CNXML to XHTML
conversions myself.
Dennis created an account for me,
but for some reason it seems to not be working.

I'm now up to
[Round 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BnS8Nq0VMpINlOaCZSswGHPt6Mti0vMnVyjhd1W8vA0/edit#heading=h.dapdzt39oa6n)
of my Thoughts on CNX document.

## How We Build Books

Helene, Ross, and I
met with Ryan
to get a brain-dump
on how we build books.
I found the discussion super helpful,
and I wrote down everything
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11RVX535Gv1j09u0baT3yTUgHtTnBkssvEWCFsw8rPp4/edit#heading=h.vq6f0s8tqd8a).

## Premature Optimization FTW?

Based on some of our CNX discussions,
and also on the talk with Ryan,
I starting thinking about what activities
need to take place
when a module is updated.
That led me to a potentially interesting breakdown
of the content production pipelines
that would (probably) result
in very fast production times.
It also has the side benefit
of clarifying exactly where/when
various pieces of information
(e.g., images, math, exercises)
get incorporated/manipulated
within the pipeline.
