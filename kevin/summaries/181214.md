Karen is still plugging away.
She's working on math-related stuff
(e.g., the MathMLCloud server)
and the CNXML to XHTML conversion stage.

I finished a draft of the
[CNX Baked-PDF CLI Tool Tech Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OOzczQx-AJKN3C2pDgbs9I1rQ8XmUchcET5k0rCGH4/edit#heading=h.rdrp96p2bs5x).

so if you know of any other consumers
let me know.
