## Dante

So that's still happening.

## Recipe-Based Pipelines

For the last week,
people have been largely distracted
by CNX critsits.
Aside from those, however,
Karen is still plugging away
and Bryan is ramping up and starting to write code.

I wrote up the
[CNX Pipeline Conop and API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q4vCuz1KO3kpexw62070xYlejkQwesq_Bo-IwBl5tyk/edit#heading=h.972l33lqr541)
for Ed this week,
but we didn't get a chance to review it
due to the critsits.

## Tutor/Biglearn Critsit(s)

Nathan and I managed to debug and fix
a few issues caused by the Dec release
that manged to linger unnoticed
until students starting working problems this semester.

The details can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dzrFVodxrJGPRTyDn_y2vwWSZIzA9gRrIJFXMVTUAzw/edit#heading=h.c15j84lu0nni).

## Thoughts on Designs

I wrote up some
[Thoughts on Designs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SGhrUz5wW_v_pFUq-GanSIpOjO3Cv-TpwXWStVG_sG4/edit#heading=h.rahrip9ehsns),
in which I try to pinpoint
certain issues that have been bothering me
about our development/design processes,
and offer some specific advice
that might help address them.

I've added it to my reading list (above).

## Access Control Requirements for Book Production

I got responses from both Anthony and Dave on this.
Basically they both agreed that content-related security
(as opposed to business-related security)
is not a huge concern
and were pretty confident
that we don't need to take unusual measures
(like separate servers, databases, etc.)
in that area.

## Complexity

I have been studying various notions
of simple, complicated, complex, and chaotic systems
to try to better understand
how OpenStax can better design our infrastructure
to be "predictable".
I've been collecting some notes
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePXC_Ia40wF6B9dSSL2gIy5TppsoXxvQJ5bMc52PHLw/edit#heading=h.8avija4t0wa5).

It turns out that
both Phil S. and Mike A.
have been pondering related topics,
and I've talked with both of them
to see where our desired outcomes overlap.
So synergy.
