## Dante

It sounds like he's on the brink
of starting to work remotely!
Woo-hoo!

## CreatorFest

This took up the majority of last week.
It seems to me like it was a success!

## CNX CLI Pipeline

I tried to run the CLI pipeline this week.
Essentially, we're back to the original situation
where one needs to install a bunch of things
directly onto one's machine.
This is a temporary setback,
but really limits my ability to test
without risking my machine's configuration.

I also talked at length with Karen
about her thoughts on the CLI project
and recommendations going forward.
It was a very good talk.

## Biglearn Feature Gathering

I've been walking through the current Tutor/Biglearn code
in order to better understand what is currently actually happening.
It takes quite a bit of time,
but I know of no faster way 
to get reliable information
(short of asking Dante).

## Thomas Upping His Game

Thomas has been working hard
to really improve his development skills.
I just wanted to call attention to it
because I think he'll be a force to be reckoned with
before too long.
