## General Notes

I've taken a few perosnal days this week
to finish my class final project.

## SGD-based SPARFA

### Python Database Stuff

We need someone who is familiar with `alembic` (python's database migration tookset)
to set up a skeleton framework for `Biglearn`.

Mike said he's get the python db prototype up and running sometime before next Fri.

### Effect of W,U,d matrix re-calculation on CLUEs

I am seeing a substantial variation in CLUE means
across imputation runs of SPARFA.
I've shown the data to Drew,
and we're trying to understand
what the underlying cause is,
and whether or not
we can prevent it.

## Biglearn Deployment

The `BL API`, `BL Scheduler`, and `BL LocalQueryClient` servers are, I believe, deployed in `-dev`,
or at least very close to being ready.
The prospects for a demo this sprint
are looking good.
