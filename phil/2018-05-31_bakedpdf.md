BakedPDF service stories

### I want an API interface for submitting a job and (eventually) responding with the URL to a Baked PDF (or errors when generating)

This is the contract that will be used to communicate between the service that does the baking and this (the service that creates the PDF).

### I want to use MathJax to render the math (and cache the computation)

This uses `jsdom` to parse the BakedHTML file, find all the MathML, convert it to MathML+SVG+HTML, and save the result to the filesystem somewhere.

### I want the service to generate a PDF that can be served for other services to consume and notify them

This uses `princexml` to generate the PDF and host the resulting PDF at a public URL.

These URLs can be predictable for debugging but it is not necessary.

### I want to have a URL to see logging for the job (Greylog?)

### I want to try building a Jenkins job to generate PDFs


# Steps to complete

1. write nodejs that converts the BakedHTML to HTML ready for Prince (runs mathjax-node on it) from the commandline
1. write nodejs code that also runs `prince` to build (& save) a PDF
1. wrap the nodejs commands in a simple webapp, serve PDFs from a tempdir
1. store jobs in an SQL DB
1. store PDF files on the filesystem
1. provide a script to garbage-collect the filesystem (& update the DB)
1. Add fault tolerance, maybe change the webapp, add Sentry reporting


# API

### This service receives

```
POST /service?secret=

{
  baked_html_url:      // Where to GET the BakedHTML file from
  css_stylesheet_url:  // Where to GET the CSS file that will be used to make the PDF
  status_callback_url: // Where to POST status notifications to
}
```

and in the response, sends a 201 (Accepted) with an optional URL to the job.


### This service sends

```
POST ${status_url}
{
  status: "PENDING", "ERROR", "FAILURE", or "SUCCESS"
  description:
  target_url:
}
```

Optionally, this service responds to:

```
GET /jobs/123

{
  created_at: "2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  updated_at: "2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  statuses: [{
    status: "PENDING", "ERROR", "FAILURE", or "SUCCESS"
    description:
    target_url:
    created_at: "2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }]
  trigger_payload: {
    {
      baked_html_url:
      css_stylesheet_url:
      status_callback_url:
    }
  }
}
```

```
GET /jobs
[
  ...
]
```
