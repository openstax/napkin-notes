## Planning for Interns

I've begin ramping up
my planning for interns.
I've pretty much got a handle
on how to bring them up to speed
on Rails-related stuff.

Next, I move on to AWS-related topics.

This is what I am going to be doing
for all of dig-out week.

than I had hoped.

I should either be directly involved,
or not involved.

really isn't doing anything for anyone.
